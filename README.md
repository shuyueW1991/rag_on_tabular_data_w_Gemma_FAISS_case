# Retriece never-empty result from a tabular structured data with RAG, Gemma, embedding model, FAISS, Pandas.

- Sometimes we need to retrieve something from a table. If there is result, that's perfectly good; but if not, i also need something because in some demos people don't care what is exactly in it. 
- There are many ways to achieve that, to the knowledge of this repo's author. This repo, on the other hand, borrowed an existing database but originally not to this purpose.
- This repository owes so much to [jaydeepthik/Gemma-RAG](https://github.com/jaydeepthik/Gemma-RAG/blob/main/Gemma_rag_movies.ipynb). Chapeau, jaydeepthik!
- You may now open 'Gemma_rag_procedures_fine_public.ipynb' to take a look. Hope this will inspires you.
